# MutBERT: Probabilistic Genome Representation Improves Genomics Foundation Models

The repo contains the official implementation of MutBERT: Probabilistic Genome Representation Improves Genomics Foundation Models.

## 1. Introduction

MutBERT, a probabilistic genome-based masked language model that eﬀiciently utilizes SNP information from population-scale genomic data. By representing the entire genome as a probabilistic distribution over observed allele frequencies, MutBERT focuses on informative genomic variations while maintaining computational eﬀiciency.
